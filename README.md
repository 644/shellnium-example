# shellnium-example
[Shellnium](https://github.com/Rasukarusan/shellnium) is the selenium webdriver for bash. This is an example of how you'd archive a webpage in .png format.

I plan to fork shellnium at some point, refactor the code, add more features (namely cookie support), and provide more robust examples like this one. The original author of shellnium did a great job, however it wasn't as intuitive to use as python's selenium.
